        <p>
        Eat fruits every day to get your natural sugars. One particular fruit which is really great is
        the apple. They say that "an apple a day keeps the doctor away" and they're not kidding!

        <p>
        Don't forget your vegetables either. Eating vegetables every day is very good for your
        body. Leafy green vegetables like lettuce are particularly good for you. Generally, you
        should have a balanced diet of vegetables, fruits, and so on.

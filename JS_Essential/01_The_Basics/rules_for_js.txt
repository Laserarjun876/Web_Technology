1.Js is case sensitive 

var date =new date(); //here Date() should be used since it is constructor date is nothing 

2.Use camelCase

i.variables start with lowercase ,methods 
getElementByTagName()
var greenDuck;
var aliceTheCamelHasFiveHumps;

ii.Objects and classes start with uppercase letter;
var date=new Date();

//Constants are all-caps:
const=CONSTANTLYUPPERCASE;

3.Whitespace matters (to Humans )
    //Best to use 
4.End Each Statement with a Semicolon 

    //Best to use 

5.Use comments liberally
